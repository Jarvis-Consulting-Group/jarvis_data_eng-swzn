# Sajad Wazin . Jarvis Consulting

I am a software developer, specialising in backend development. Since 2016, I have been working on projects in a variety of fields, all at different levels of difficulty. My main programming languages are Java, C/C++ and Python, with a heavy focus on software architecture, data science and algorithms. During my 3 years Bachelor of Science program at McGill University, I was able to gather a variety of skills that aid me on a daily basis. Among those skills are the ability to design secure and optimized software, the ability to analyze and develop complex algorithms and the ability to use my knowledge of software development in combination with mathematics to deliver a fault-proof product. Furthermore, in combination with my research at McGill University, understanding and developing conscious, reliable and expandable software is an important part of all my tasks.
